# Smith-Waterman aligner with fixed gap penalty. NOTE: This is not
# going to be fast! It's intended for small jobs like finding
# adapters. We need a C version for the heavy lifting.

# To use, create the aligner object, call setRef and setRead, then
# call fillMatrix, which returns the alignment score. If you like
# that, call alignmentStrings to get printable strings showing the
# alignment.

# An aligner object can be reused for repeated alignments. Ref and
# Read are whatever you last specified.
