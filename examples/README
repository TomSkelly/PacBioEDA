This directory contains examples of the output from the various
PacBioEDA scripts. In most cases, the example file is the direct
output of the script. In the case of PacBio_Bas-exerpts.txt, the file
contains a subset of the output of PacBio_Bas.py (which totalled xxMB)
for a few selected ZMWs of interest, with explanatory annotations
added by hand.
